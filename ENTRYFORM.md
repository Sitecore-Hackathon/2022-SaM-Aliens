You can find a very good reference to Github flavoured markdown reference in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you want something a bit more WYSIWYG for editing then could use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) which provides a more user friendly interface for generating the Markdown code. Those of you who are [VS Code fans](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can edit/preview directly in that interface too.

## Comments
We will be happy to collabarate Sitecore Dev team to finish this module. 

At least, we can Licence generating for specific person or Licence configuring. For example, MVP user can configure Licence file only for Sitecore 10.2 related because the full Licence file pretty long.
